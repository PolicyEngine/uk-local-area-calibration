The transformation involves matrix multiplication between a vector of 2010 codes and a mapping matrix. The matrix multiplication will give you the corresponding values for the 2024 codes, with values distributed according to the mapping from 2010 codes to 2024 codes.

1. Matrix Setup
---------------
- Input Vector (v_2010): This is a vector representing the values associated with each `code_2010`. It has dimensions n x 1, where n is the number of unique 2010 codes.

- Mapping Matrix (M): This matrix maps `code_2010` to `code_2024`. It has dimensions n x m, where n is the number of unique `code_2010` entries (rows), and m is the number of unique `code_2024` entries (columns). Each entry in the matrix represents the proportion of the value from `code_2010` mapped to `code_2024`.

- Output Vector (v_2024): This is the resulting vector of values for the `code_2024` entries. It has dimensions m x 1, where m is the number of unique 2024 codes.

2. Matrix Multiplication
-------------------------
To calculate the transformed vector for 2024 codes (v_2024), the following matrix multiplication is performed:

v_2024 = v_2010 * M

This equation means that each element of the resulting vector v_2024 is computed as a weighted sum of the elements from v_2010, where the weights are determined by the corresponding entries in the mapping matrix M.
