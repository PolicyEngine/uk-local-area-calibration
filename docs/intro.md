# Introduction

This repository contains the methodology and tools for calibrating local area statistics across UK constituencies. The calibration process ensures accurate representation of income distributions and demographic characteristics at the constituency level, accommodating the transition from 2010 to 2024 constituency boundaries.
We provide the following components:

1. A methodology page describing our data sources, mapping framework, and calibration techniques.
2. A validation page demonstrating the accuracy of our calibration by comparing estimated values against actual target statistics across UK parliamentary constituencies under the new 2024 boundaries.
3. An example page showcasing how this calibration can be applied to policy analysis, using Labour's 2024 Autumn Budget proposals as a case study to examine geographical variations in household income changes between 2024 and 2029.

Each section provides code, documentation, and interactive visualizations to help users understand and apply these calibration techniques to their own policy analysis work.
